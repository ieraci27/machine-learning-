# Regression Analysis in Data Science

This repository contains a collection of regression analysis experiments, showcasing various regression techniques in data science. Regression is a fundamental statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this project, we explore different regression models, evaluate their performance, and provide insights into when to use them.

## Introduction

In the field of data science, regression analysis is a powerful tool for predicting and understanding relationships between variables. This repository serves as a resource for learning and experimenting with various regression techniques, including but not limited to:

- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- and more...

## Regression Models

Each regression model is implemented and documented in its own separate folder within this repository. You can find detailed explanations and code examples for each model in the respective folders.

- [Linear Regression](./Linear%20Regression/)
- [Polynomial Regression](./Polynomial%20Regression/)
- [Support Vector Regression (SVR)](./SVR/)
- [Decision Tree Regression](./Decision%20Tree%20Regression/)
- [Random Forest Regression](./Random%20Forest%20Regression/)
- [...](./Other%20Regression%20Models/)

## Dataset

To perform these regression experiments, we have used a publicly available dataset. The dataset details and sources can be found in the dataset-specific folders within the model directories.

## Usage

To use and experiment with any of the regression models, navigate to the respective model's folder. Each model folder contains the following:

1. Model implementation code (usually in Python).
2. Example dataset for testing.
3. Jupyter notebooks or scripts for running and visualizing the model's performance.

Clone this repository to your local machine and follow the instructions provided in each model's README file to get started with your regression analysis.

## Results

We have evaluated the performance of each regression model and provided insights into their strengths and weaknesses in the respective model's documentation.

## Contributing
